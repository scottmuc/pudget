        Bostrom of the University of Oxford talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts
        about his book, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. Bostrom argues
        that when machines exist which dwarf human intelligence they will threaten
        human existence unless steps are taken now to reduce the risk. The conversation
        covers the likelihood of the worst scenarios, strategies that might be used
        to reduce the risk and the implications for labor markets, and human flourishing

        about Russ's new book, How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected

        Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology talks with EconTalk host
        Russ Roberts about the future of work and the role that automation and smart
        machines might play in the workforce. Autor stresses the importance of Michael
        Polanyi's insight that many of the things we know and understand cannot be
        easily written down or communicated. Those kinds of tacit knowledge will be
        difficult for smart machines to access and use. In addition, Autor argues
        that fundamentally, the gains from machine productivity will accrue to humans.
        The conversation closes with a discussion of the distributional implications
        of a world with a vastly larger role for smart machines.</description>\r\n<itunes:summary>David

        let people share their houses, cars, or other assets with strangers in exchange
        for money. These companies dramatically increase the use of resources that
        would otherwise be idle and disrupt existing services such as hotels and taxis.

        of Right and Left, talks to EconTalk host Russ Roberts about the ideas of
        Burke and Paine and their influence on the evolution of political philosophy.
        Levin outlines the differing approaches of the two thinkers to liberty, authority,
        and how reform and change should take place. Other topics discussed include
        Hayek's view of tradition, Cartesian rationalism, the moral high ground in
        politics, and how the \"right and left\" division of American politics finds
        its roots in the debates of these thinkers from the 1700s.</description>\r\n<itunes:summary>Yuval

        Christy and Kerry Emanuel talk with host Russ Roberts about climate change.
        Topics include what we know and don't know about global warming, trends in
        extreme weather such as hurricanes, rising sea level, the likely change in
        temperature in the next hundred years. Both scientists also give their perspective
        on what policies might be put in place to reduce risk from climate change.
        This episode was recorded before a live audience at the College of Business
        Administration at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.</itunes:subtitle>\r\n\r\n<itunes:keywords>economics,

        Russ Roberts about his book--a discussion of why allergies and autoimmune
        diseases have been on the rise in the developed world for the last half-century.
        Velasquez-Manoff explores a recent hypothesis in the epidemiological literature
        theorizing the increase is a response to the overly hygienic environment in
        rich countries and the absence of various microbes and parasites. Velasquez-Manoff
        also considers whether reintroducing parasites into our bodies can have therapeutic
        effects, a possibility currently under examination through FDA trials. The

        Kotlikoff of Boston University talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about
        the fiscal health of the federal government of the United States. Kotlikoff
        argues that the U.S. government is essentially bankrupt because future taxes
        will fall hundreds of trillions of dollars short of expected expenditures.

        Thurman describes how farmers hire beekeepers to pollinate their crops and
        how that market keeps improving crop yields and producing honey. Thurman then
        discusses how beekeepers have responded to Colony Collapse Disorder--a not

        Ralston Saul, author and head of PEN International, speaks with EconTalk host
        Russ Roberts about his book, Voltaire's Bastards, and the role of reason in
        the modern world. Saul argues that the illegitimate offspring of the champions
        of reason have led to serious problems in the modern world. Reason, while
        powerful and useful, says Saul, should not be put on a pedestal above other
        values including morality and common-sense. Saul argues that the worship of
        reason has corrupted public policy and education while empowering technocrats
        and the elites in dangerous and unhealthy ways.</description>\r\n<itunes:summary>John

        April 10, 2013, Liberty Fund and Butler University sponsored a symposium,
        \"Capitalism, Government, and the Good Society.\" The evening began with solo
        presentations by the three participants--Michael Munger of Duke University,
        Robert Skidelsky of the University of Warwick, and Richard Epstein of New
        York University. (Travel complications forced the fourth invited participant,
        James Galbraith of the University of Texas, to cancel.) Each speaker gave
        his own interpretation of the appropriate role for government in the economy
        and in our lives. This was followed by a lively conversation on the topic
        moderated by Russ Roberts of Stanford University, host of the weekly podcast,

        Fiorina talks with host Russ Roberts about the state of the American electorate
        and recent election results. Fiorina argues that while the Republican and
        Democratic parties are more extreme than they were in the past, there has
        been only modest change in the character of the American electorate. Fiorina
        discusses these differences in light of recent election results which show
        an inability of either party to sustain control of the Presidency or the Congress.</itunes:subtitle>\r\n\r\n<itunes:keywords>economics,

        Munger of Duke University talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about the
        role of formal rules and informal rules in sports. Many sports restrain violence
        and retaliation through formal rules while in others, protective equipment
        is used to reduce injury. In all sports, codes of conduct emerge to deal with
        violence and unobserved violations of formal rules. Munger explores the interaction
        of these forces across different sports and how they relate to insights of

        word and continues up through radio and the internet. A particular focus of
        the conversation is how tyrants use information technology to oppress their
        people but at the same time, technology can be used to liberate people from

        Galbraith looks at a variety of different measures and ways of analyzing income

        to changes in specific counties or industries. Other topics discussed include

        Admati argues that the best way to reduce the fragility of the banking system
        is to increase capital requirements--that is, require banks to finance their
        activities with a greater proportion of equity rather than debt. She explains
        how debt magnifies returns and losses while making each bank more fragile.
        Despite claims to the contrary, she argues that the costs of reducing debt
        are relatively small for society as a whole while the benefits are substantial.</description>\r\n<itunes:summary>Anat

        EconTalk host Russ Roberts about the political malaise in America, whether
        it could lead to a Constitutional Convention, and what might emerge were such

        in designing public policy, relying instead on the merits of policy regardless
        of their constitutionality. Seidman defends his position by citing examples
        in the past where constitutionality has been ignored and says it would be
        better to recognize our disdain for the Constitution in a transparent way.
        In this lively conversation, Roberts pushes back against these ideas, citing
